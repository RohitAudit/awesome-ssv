# LSD staking pool powered by SSV

This repo showcases how to **create and run LSD staking pool** leveraging ssv.network.

If you are looking for other resources to help you start building, check out [awesome-ssv](https://github.com/bloxapp/awesome-ssv) repo, a curated list of SSV tools & projects & guides.

This lsd-pool is separated from the awesome-ssv of which it was a part of in the past.

### Description

Launch a minimalistic fully working LSD staking pool.

It is **for learning purposes ONLY** and NOT to be used in production!

It consists of Frontend based on scaffold-eth, backend creating + managing validators and smart contracts to manage ETH, mint an LSD token (ssvETH).

It leverages ssv.network to **run validators in a distributed and decentralized manner**.

## Video walkthrough

### With Frontend

### Credits

Huge thanks to

- [@RohitAudit](https://github.com/RohitAudit) who develops & maintains all the **backend** magic on whose [repo-Garuda](https://github.com/RohitAudit/ssv-service) this minimalistic LSD staking pool is based on.

- [@nibthebear](https://github.com/TIM88-DOT) who has developed the **frontend**, js deployment, and revamped the **smart contracts**.

## How it works

- Staking has never been so easy, thanks to SSV, you can stake your ETH and earn ssvETH without running your own validator! ðŸ¤‘

### User Actions

- Users stake their ETH to a staking contract for which he is minted a liquid staked derivative token, ssvETH.

- Creates an Ethereum validator key and gives it to the staking pool to deposit for activation

- Generates keyshares from the validator keystore and stakes them with the SSV nodes

- Saves the keystore and keyshares for verification at a later stage

## How to deploy?

### 1. Front End plus Smart contracts - Scaffold-eth framework

If you want to deploy smart contract together with frontend using scaffold-eth framework (hardhat + react) built in `JS` continue to [RUN_SMART_CONTRACTS_AND_FRONTEND.md](/RUN_SMART_CONTRACTS_AND_FRONTEND.md).

It will navigate you through the remaining process.

## OR

### 2. Smart Contracts Only - Brownie framework

If you want to deploy smart contracts only using brownie framework built in `PY` continue to [RUN_SMART_CONTRACTS_ONLY.md](/RUN_SMART_CONTRACTS_ONLY.md).

It will navigate you through the remaining process.

## What to build?

This repo is meant to give you a head start in building a cool prototype of the next big staking app. Build something interesting on top such as transferable NFT validators, Restaking app, or whatever else, and **open PR**.
